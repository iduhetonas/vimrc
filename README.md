Vim configuration by Tyler Huffman
==================================

## Overview
This is my vimrc configuration, based initially on https://github.com/amix/vimrc but has since deviated and become a much more simplified, easier to modify vimrc configuration.

## Installation

### Linux/Mac/Unix
Run these commands in your terminal.

   git clone http://github.com/iduhetonas/vimrc.git ~/vimrc
   cd ~/vimrc
   ./install_vimrc.sh

And you are good to go! Remember to install ctags as well for Tagbar support.

### Windows
Currently, there is no easy way to install this configuration in Windows, but it can be done.

## Plugins
I will fill these in later.
