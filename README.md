Vim configuration by Tyler Huffman
==================================

## Overview
This is my vimrc configuration, based initially on https://github.com/amix/vimrc but has since deviated with a full rewrite, and has become a much more simplified, easier to modify vimrc configuration.

## Requirements

Vim 7.3+
git (for cloning the plugins)

### Optional Requirements

Pyclewn - For Vim-integrated C++ and Python debugging.

hdevtools - For Haskell development type checking and type information.

## Installation

### Linux/Mac/Unix
Run these commands in your terminal.

    git clone http://github.com/iduhetonas/vimrc.git ~/vimrc
    cd ~/vimrc
    ./install_vimrc.sh

And you are good to go! Remember to install ctags as well for Tagbar support.

### Windows
Currently, there is no easy way to install this configuration in Windows, but it can be done.
